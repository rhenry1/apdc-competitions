# APDC Competition Schedule Portal

A static, offline-capable PWA schedule portal for Amanda Page Dance Company —
no backend, no build step, hosted on GitHub Pages. See `docs/V2-ROADMAP.md`
for the full project history and what's next.

## Why some things live where they do

A few of these paths are fixed by convention, not preference — moving them
would break the live site, GitHub Pages, or the PWA:

- `index.html`, `<competition>/index.html`, `manifest.json`,
  `service-worker.js`, `404.html` — must stay where browsers, GitHub Pages,
  and the installed PWA expect to find them. Competition folder names are
  also live, shareable URLs (`/nationals-2026/`) — renaming one breaks
  every link and calendar file already shared for that competition.
- `og-image.png` — referenced by an absolute URL in every page's share
  meta tags; social platforms may have already cached that exact URL.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `playwright.config.js`,
  `.github/workflows/` — read from fixed locations by npm, Playwright, and
  GitHub Actions respectively.

Everything else (`icons/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `worker/`, `tests/`) is free
to reorganize since nothing outside this repo depends on those paths.

## Local development

```bash
npm ci
npm test                  # full Playwright suite (chromium + webkit)
npm run build:noscript    # regenerate the no-JS fallback after editing SCHEDULE
```

No dev server is required to browse the site itself — it's plain static
HTML/CSS/JS. The test suite spins up its own local server.
